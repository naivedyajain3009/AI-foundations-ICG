# AI-Foundations

Official repository for the Winter Project AI Foundations offered by ICG

**Project Objective** : To learn about AI programming techniques from the ground up, all the way till we evaluate our CNN model on the domain of sign language, possibly creating a live feed sign language detection model.



### Segment 0

Revision of basic python, along with the three essential data science libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib

Rolled out Assignment 0, testing both the programming and the applicative aspect of using these libraries in data science.

### Segment 1

We then moved onto common use data science ML models, namely linear and logistic regression. After going through its theory, mentees were asked to create linear regression models to analyze and predict dependencies between advertising budget and sales of a test company. They were further tasked with creating a logistic regression model to predict heights given weight.
